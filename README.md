# ATnoX

## Introduction

The ATnoX was born out of the necessity for me to have a small adapter adapter I could use to fit AT/XT motherboards into modern cases, powering them with ATX power supplies and turning them on with a momentary switch (the standard power on button present in computer cases built in the last 20+ years).

The [ATX2AT](https://x86.fr/atx2at-smart-converter/) is a wonderful device (I own several of them), but I prefer to use it to test my boards and then fall back onto a cheaper alternative I can close inside a case without it feeling like a waste.

In fact, the output connector uses the same pinout as the ATX2AT, but as I still had a free pin available, I decided to include a **TICK generator**: a 50/60hz square wave signal required by some big-box Amigas to turn on.
